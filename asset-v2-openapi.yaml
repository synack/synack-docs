        Retrieve the list of assets for one or more organizations, considering
        filtering and pagination query parameters. When an organization-level
        OAuth2 scope is provided, the results will be restricted to those
        organizations the user is authorized for. Similarly, if a listing-
        level OAuth2 scope is provided, the results will be restricted to those
        listings the user is authorized for.

        Additional query parameters generally restrict the resulting set of
        assets according to AND semantics.

        Use of organizationUid and listingUid query parameters will further
        restrict the results.

        If neither are specified, the returned assets are the set of assets
        the user is allowed to access with organization OR listing specific
        privileges.

        If listing UIDs are supplied without organization UIDs, then only the
        assets assigned to those listings (which the user is authorized for)
        will be returned. Conversely, if organization UIDs are supplied without
        listing UIDs, then only the assets owned by those organizations (which
        the the user is authorized for) will be returned.

        Should both organization UIDs and listing UIDs be supplied, then the set
        of assets returned is restricted to assets assigned to any of the
        supplied listings, AND owned by any of the supplied organizations,
        further restricted to only those the user is authorized to access.

        Researcher users are restricted to only viewing credentials of in scope
        assets for listings to which they have been assigned.

            E.g. CloudEnumeration hosts are valid for 1 hour from each time they are discovered, maxHostDiscoveryAgeMins=0 means that
            if the end time of the relationship has passed, the asset will not be returned - maxHostDiscoveryAgeMins=60 however, would return assets
